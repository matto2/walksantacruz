I want to reformat all the Tour detail pages - starting with downtown tour - I want the content strategy to be more like the below - here\'92s what I want to emulate: big clear photo on top (ok to leave current photo just remove the dark scrim) - title under that - then trip highlights in bullet form (this is instead of the big numbered itenerary with  big descriptions ) - Then the Book Your Tour section (reword title if possible) this is instead of the side card and sticky section on mobile - ok to keep pricing and duration and book button - After that have a written decsription (combine the existing text and place it here - copy the length and tone) - Do not copy calendar - Yes copy the general sections below that but change the headlines slightly - the gallery can have just one photo for now - I will add more - Refactor current layout to fit this content layout below the gallery and overall - stop with questions - remove the stuff that doesn\'92t fit this layout - remove / reformat sticky section on mobile\
