## About Your Guide

Hi! I'm **[Guide Name]**, a Santa Cruz native with a passion for our town's rich history and vibrant culture.  
After studying local history at UC Santa Cruz I decided to share my knowledge and love for this special coastal community through walking tours.

What started as occasional tours for friends and family has grown into _Walk Santa Cruz_, where I get to share the stories, secrets, and special places that make our town unique.

From the historic Mission Hill district to the evolving downtown scene, I love helping visitors and locals alike discover Santa Cruz through a new lens.

My tours combine historical facts with personal insights, local recommendations, and the kind of stories you won't find in guidebooks.

I believe the best way to experience Santa Cruz is on foot ‚Äî with a friendly local guide to show you the way.

I look forward to walking with you soon!
